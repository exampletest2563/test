[Slide 1: Introduction to Type Conversion & Casting]
- ➡️ Type Conversion & Casting are essential concepts in C# that allow you to convert data from one type to another. Whether you're dealing with numbers, characters, or custom objects, understanding how to navigate between types is crucial for writing efficient and flexible code.

[Slide 2: Implicit Type Conversion]
- 🎭 Implicit Type Conversion, also known as widening or automatic conversion, occurs when C# automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger one without loss of data.

[Slide 3: Example - Implicit Type Conversion]
- 🎉 Time for an example! If you have an `int` variable `numInt = 42`, you can implicitly convert it to a `double` with `double numDouble = numInt`. No explicit casting is required in this case. Experiment with different data types to see implicit conversion in action.

[Slide 4: Explicit Type Conversion (Casting)]
- 🎭 Explicit Type Conversion, or casting, is required when converting a larger data type to a smaller one or when the conversion may result in data loss. It's your way of telling the compiler, "I know what I'm doing."

[Slide 5: Example - Explicit Type Conversion (Casting)]
- 🌟 Let's visualize it! If you have a `double` variable `pi = 3.14159`, you can explicitly convert it to an `int` with `int intPi = (int)pi`. This is necessary because casting from a floating-point type to an integer may result in data loss. Experiment with different data types to see explicit conversion in action.

[Slide 6: Common Explicit Conversions]
- 🎭 Common explicit conversions include converting between numeric types, such as `int` to `double` or `float` to `int`. Additionally, converting from `string` to numeric types is a common scenario.
