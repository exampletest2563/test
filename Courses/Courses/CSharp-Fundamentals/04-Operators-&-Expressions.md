- 🤔 Consider `x = 9` (binary: 1001) and `y = 6` (binary: 0110). The expression `x | y` results in `15` (binary: 1111). Play around with different values to see the OR operator in action.

[Slide 6: XOR Operator (^)]
- ⛓️ The XOR Operator (`^`) performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation. It sets a bit to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.

[Slide 7: Example - XOR Operator]
- 🌟 Let's visualize it! If `m = 12` (binary: 1100) and `n = 7` (binary: 0111), then `m ^ n` results in `11` (binary: 1011). Explore different values to understand how the XOR operator works.

[Slide 8: NOT Operator (~)]
- 🔀 The NOT Operator (`~`) is a unary operator that performs a bitwise NOT operation. It flips the bits, turning 0s into 1s and vice versa.

[Slide 9: Example - NOT Operator]
- 🎩 Time for a quick demo! If `p = 10` (binary: 1010), then `~p` results in `-11` (binary: 0101). Keep in mind that the NOT operator also flips the sign. Experiment with different values to see the NOT operator in action.

[Slide 10: Left Shift Operator (<<) and Right Shift Operator (>>)]
- ⏪⏩ The Left Shift (`<<`) and Right Shift (`>>`) Operators shift the bits of a number to the left or right by a specified number of positions.

[Slide 11: Example - Left Shift and Right Shift Operators]
- 🚀 Let's dive in! If `num = 5` (binary: 0101), then `num << 2` shifts the bits to the left, resulting in `20` (binary: 10100). Conversely, `num >> 1` shifts the bits to the right, resulting in `2` (binary: 0010). Explore different shift values to understand the dynamics.

## Operators Precedence

[Opening Slide]
- 🚀 Welcome back to the "C# Fundamentals" course! Today, we're unraveling the mystery of "Operators Precedence" in C#. Get ready to understand the rules that govern the order in which operators are evaluated, ensuring your code executes as expected. 🎯

[Slide 1: Introduction to Operators Precedence]
- ➡️ Operators Precedence is the set of rules that dictate the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Just like in a mathematical equation, certain operators take precedence over others. Let's dive into these rules and demystify the sequence of operations in your code.

[Slide 2: Basic Arithmetic Operators Precedence]
- 🧮 In C#, basic arithmetic operators follow the standard rules. Multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction. You can use parentheses to enforce a specific order.

[Slide 3: Example - Basic Arithmetic Operators Precedence]
- 🎉 Time for an example! If `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and `c = 2`, then `result = a + b * c` results in `20` because multiplication has higher precedence. However, `(a + b) * c` results in `30` due to the parentheses. Experiment with different values to grasp the importance of precedence.

[Slide 4: Comparison and Logical Operators Precedence]
- ⚖️ When it comes to comparison and logical operators, they follow their own set of rules. Logical AND (`&&`) and logical OR (`||`) have lower precedence than most comparison operators.

[Slide 5: Example - Comparison and Logical Operators Precedence]
- 🤔 Consider `x = 8`, `y = 5`, and `z = 10`. The expression `x > y && x < z` is `true` because the comparison operators have higher precedence than the logical AND operator. Experiment with different values to understand how precedence influences the outcome.

[Slide 6: Mixing Different Operators]
- ⚙️ In real-world scenarios, you often use a mix of operators in an expression. Understanding precedence ensures that your code behaves as intended.

[Slide 7: Example - Mixing Different Operators]
- 🌟 Let's visualize it! If `a = 15`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, then `result = a / b + c` results in `7` because division has higher precedence than addition. Experiment with different combinations to see how operators interact.

[Slide 8: Changing Precedence with Parentheses]
- 🔄 Parentheses play a crucial role in changing the default precedence. You can use them to explicitly define the order of evaluation.

[Slide 9: Example - Changing Precedence with Parentheses]
- 🎩 Time for a quick demo! If `x = 4`, `y = 2`, and `z = 3`, then `(x + y) * z` results in `18` because the addition inside the parentheses takes precedence. Experiment with different arrangements to see the impact of parentheses.

[Slide 10: Bitwise Operators Precedence]
- 🔍 Bitwise operators also have their own precedence rules. Understanding these rules is essential when working with binary operations.

[Slide 11: Example - Bitwise Operators Precedence]
- 🚀 Let's dive into the world of bits! If `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 3`, then `result = num1 & num2 | num1 << 1` involves both bitwise AND and OR operations. Experiment with different values to master the intricacies of bitwise operators.

[Slide 12: Recap and Next Steps]
- 🎓 Bravo! You've mastered the art of Operators Precedence in C#. Today, we covered basic arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators, and how precedence influences their order of evaluation. Join us in the upcoming modules for more coding adventures in the "C# Fundamentals" course.

## Brackets Operator

[Opening Slide]
- 🚀 Welcome back to the "C# Fundamentals" course! Today, we're exploring the powerful "Brackets Operator" in C#. Get ready to understand how these humble brackets, also known as parentheses, play a pivotal role in controlling the flow and structure of your code. 🧱

[Slide 1: Introduction to Brackets Operator]
- ➡️ The Brackets Operator, represented by parentheses `()`, is a fundamental element in C# that serves multiple purposes. From defining method parameters to changing operators precedence, let's unravel the versatility of these brackets.

[Slide 2: Grouping Expressions]
- 🤝 One primary function of the brackets is to group expressions, altering the order of evaluation. This is crucial for ensuring that specific operations are performed together.

[Slide 3: Example - Grouping Expressions]
- 🎉 Time for an example! If `a = 5`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, then `(a + b) * c` results in `16` because the addition inside the parentheses takes precedence. Experiment with different values to see how grouping impacts the outcome.

[Slide 4: Method Calls and Parameters]
- 📞 Brackets are essential when calling methods or defining method parameters. They encapsulate the input values that the method operates on.

[Slide 5: Example - Method Calls and Parameters]
- 🌟 Let's visualize it! If you have a method `CalculateSum(int x, int y)`, calling it as `CalculateSum(3, 7)` involves brackets to enclose the parameters. Experiment with different methods and parameters to see how brackets facilitate method calls.

[Slide 6: Conditional Statements and Loops]
- ⚙️ Brackets are used to define the scope of conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while). They encapsulate the block of code that should be executed conditionally or repeatedly.

[Slide 7: Example - Conditional Statements and Loops]
- 🚀 Time for a quick demo! If `num = 5`, then the code block inside the `if (num > 0)` statement is enclosed in brackets. Experiment with different conditions to see how brackets define the scope of your code.

[Slide 8: Changing Operators Precedence]
- 🔍 Brackets play a crucial role in changing the default precedence of operators. They allow you to explicitly define the order in which operations are evaluated.

[Slide 9: Example - Changing Operators Precedence with Brackets]
- 🎩 Let's dive into the world of precedence! If `x = 4`, `y = 2`, and `z = 3`, then `(x + y) * z` results in `18` because the addition inside the parentheses takes precedence. Experiment with different arrangements to see the impact of brackets on operators precedence.

[Slide 10: Exception Handling]
- 🚨 In exception handling, brackets define the scope of the code that should be executed in case of an exception. The `try` and `catch` blocks are enclosed in brackets.

[Slide 11: Example - Exception Handling]
- 🌐 Let's explore! If you have a `try` block attempting a risky operation and a `catch` block handling the exception, both blocks are enclosed in brackets. Experiment with different scenarios to see how brackets structure your exception handling.

[Slide 12: Recap and Next Steps]
- 🎓 Bravo! You've mastered the role of the Brackets Operator in C#. Today, we covered grouping expressions, method calls and parameters, conditional statements and loops, changing operators precedence, and exception handling.
