The evolution of the `World Wide Web` (`Web`) has been a remarkable journey, shaping the way information is shared, accessed, and experienced globally.

In 1989, `Tim Berners-Lee`, a British computer scientist, proposed the concept of a `decentralized information system` that would eventually become the `World Wide Web`. His vision included the use of `hypertext` to link documents and a system of `uniform resource identifiers` to uniquely identify resources.

In 1990, `Tim Berners-Lee` implemented the first successful communication between a `Hypertext Transfer Protocol` (`HTTP`) client and server, effectively creating the foundation for the `Web`. The first website, `info.cern.ch`, and the first web browser, `WorldWideWeb` (later renamed `Nexus`), were developed in 1991.

There is a difference between `Internet` and `Web` as `Internet` refers to a network of networks that connects devices all over the world, while `Web` is an information system that enables information sharing over the `Internet`.

**[Closing Credits with Uplifting Outro Music]**

**Disclaimer:** "HTML5 Fundamentals" is not responsible for any newfound addiction to coding. Viewer discretion is advised. Happy coding! 😄👩‍💻👨‍💻

`HTML` (HyperText Markup Language) is used to define `the content` of Web pages. It uses elements, tags and attributes to define building blocks/components such as `headings`, `paragraphs`, `images`, `links`, and more.

HTML Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Document</title>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>HTML Introduction</h1>
	    <p>This is a basic HTML document.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

`CSS` (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to specify `the layout` of Web pages. `CSS` is responsible for styling HTML elements, controlling `layout`, `design`, and `presentation`. `CSS` was introduced to separate the presentation of Web documents from their structure.

CSS Example:

```css
body {
	font-family: 'Arial';
	background-color: white;
}

h1 {
	color: black;
	text-align: center;
}

p {
	font-size: 14px;
}
```

`JavaScript` is used to program `the behavior` of Web pages (client-side interactivity), significantly enhancing the user experience.

JavaScript Example:

```js
document.getElementById("demo").style.visibility = "hidden";
```

`Separation of Concerns` is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections. Each section addresses a separate concern, a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.

`HTML` is mainly used for organization of webpage content, `CSS` is used for definition of content presentation style, and `JS` defines how the content interacts and behaves with the user. Historically, this was not the case: prior to the introduction of `CSS`, `HTML` performed both duties of defining semantics and style.

## Front-End & Back-End

**Front-End vs. Back-End: Unveiling the Web Development Divide**
