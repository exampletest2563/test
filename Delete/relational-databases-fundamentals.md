CREATE TABLE EmployeeSkill (
    EmployeeID INT,
    Skill VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID, Skill),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employee(EmployeeID)
);
```

### 3.2 Second Normal Form (2NF)

#### 3.2.1 Definition

In 2NF, the table must be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes should be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.

#### 3.2.2 Example

Consider an order table with product details:

```sql
-- Not in 2NF
CREATE TABLE Order (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID INT,
    ProductName VARCHAR(50),
    Quantity INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID)
);

-- In 2NF
CREATE TABLE Order (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Product(ProductID)
);

CREATE TABLE Product (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### 3.3 Third Normal Form (3NF)

#### 3.3.1 Definition

In 3NF, the table must be in 2NF, and there should be no transitive dependencies between non-key attributes.

#### 3.3.2 Example

Consider an employee table with department details:

```sql
-- Not in 3NF
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentID INT,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID)
);

-- In 3NF
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Department(DepartmentID)
);

CREATE TABLE Department (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## 4. Benefits of Normalization

1. **Reduced Redundancy:** By organizing data efficiently, normalization minimizes duplicated information in the database.

2. **Improved Data Integrity:** Normalization helps maintain data accuracy and consistency, reducing the likelihood of errors.

3. **Simplified Updates:** With normalized tables, updates and modifications can be made more efficiently without impacting other parts of the database.

4. **Enhanced Query Performance:** Well-normalized databases often result in faster query performance, as data retrieval becomes more streamlined.

## 5. Considerations and Trade-offs

1. **Over-normalization:** Excessive normalization can lead to increased complexity and may not always be suitable for certain types of queries.

2. **Denormalization:** In some cases, deliberately introducing redundancy (denormalization) may be necessary to optimize specific query performance.

## 6. Conclusion

Normalization is a foundational principle in relational database design, promoting efficiency, accuracy, and maintainability. This chapter has explored the essential concepts of normalization, including the first, second, and third normal forms, along with their practical applications and benefits. As you delve into database design, mastering normalization principles will contribute to the creation of well-structured, robust databases tailored to meet the needs of your applications.
