```css
/* Absolute Units Example */
.container {
    width: 300px; /* Fixed width of 300 pixels */
    font-size: 16pt; /* Font size set to 16 points */
}
```

#### 9.2.2 Relative Units

Relative units offer flexibility by adjusting measurements based on the context or the parent element's properties. Em (`em`), Rem (`rem`), Percentage (`%`), Viewport Width (`vw`), and Viewport Height (`vh`) are popular relative units.

```css
/* Relative Units Example */
.container {
    font-size: 1.2em; /* Font size is 1.2 times the parent element's font size */
    margin: 5%; /* Margin is 5% of the parent element's width */
}
```

#### 9.2.3 Font-relative Units

Font-relative units, like `em` and `rem`, are particularly useful for responsive typography, allowing text to scale proportionally with the parent element's font size.

```css
/* Font-relative Units Example */
.container {
    font-size: 18px; /* Base font size set to 18 pixels */
}

.text {
    font-size: 1.5em; /* Font size is 1.5 times the base font size, i.e., 27 pixels */
}
```

### 9.3 Choosing the Right Unit for the Job

#### 9.3.1 When to Use Pixels

Pixels (`px`) are ideal for fixed-size elements where precision is crucial. However, they may not adapt well to different screen sizes.

#### 9.3.2 Leveraging Relative Units

Relative units, such as `em` and `rem`, are excellent for creating flexible and scalable designs, especially for font sizes and spacing.

#### 9.3.3 Embracing Percentage

Percentage units are versatile, offering proportional sizing relative to the parent element. They shine in creating responsive layouts.

```css
/* Percentage Units Example */
.container {
    width: 50%; /* Occupies 50% of the parent container's width */
}
```

#### 9.3.4 Viewport Units for Responsive Design

Viewport units (`vw` and `vh`) are dynamic, adjusting to the viewport's dimensions. They are particularly effective for responsive layouts.

```css
/* Viewport Units Example */
.container {
    height: 80vh; /* Sets the height to 80% of the viewport height */
}
```

### 9.4 Best Practices for CSS Units

#### 9.4.1 Use Relative Units for Flexibility

Prefer relative units for elements that should adapt to different contexts or screen sizes, promoting a responsive and scalable design.

#### 9.4.2 Combine Units Thoughtfully

Combine different units judiciously based on the property's nature and the design requirements, ensuring a harmonious layout.
